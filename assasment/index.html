    <h2>Data Mining</h2>
    <p>
      A major research interest is data mining and I run a meeting group here at
      Stanford. For more information take a look at the
      <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/midas/midas.html"> MIDAS </a>
      home page or see the datamine maling list achive. Here are some recent
      publications:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Extracting Patterns and Relations from the World Wide Web</b></li>
      <p>
        by Sergey Brin. We demonstrate a technique for extracting relations from
        the WWW based on the duality of patterns and relations. We experiment
        with it by extracting a relations of books. WebDB Workshop at EDBT '98

          >Dynamic Data Mining: A New Architecture for Data with
          HighDimensionality
        </b>
      </li>
      <p>
        by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page. We describe a new architecture for
        data mining (sorry not yet available online). It makes use of some of
        the dynamic itemset counting technology described below. Work in
        progress. (postscript)

      <li>
        <b>Scalable Techniques for Mining Causal Structures </b>
      </li>
      <p>
        by Craig Silverstein, Sergey Brin, Rajeev Motwani, and Jeff Ullman. We
        address mining for causality, not just correlation in data. To appear in

        by Sergey Brin. Rajeev Motwani, Jeffrey D. Ullman and Shalom Tsur. We
        present and algorithm for counting large itemsets faster than previous
        algorithms. We rely on partial results to guide the mining process.

      Research on the Web seems to be fashionable these days and I guess I'm no
      exception. Recently I have been working on the Google search engine with
      Larry Page.

      This project involved indexing multidimensional data for near-neighbor
      searches. The kind of applications I envision are identity comparisons,
      information finding, molecular biology, ...

      <li>Near Neighbor Search in Large Metric Spaces</li>
      <p>

        We introduce a new data structure for near-neighbor searches which is
        well suited for high-dimensional or "large" metric spaces.<br />VLDB '95

    <p>
      I worked on a project with Hector Garcia-Molina involving automated
      detection of copyright violations. Together with James Davis (another
      Ph.D. student here), we developed COPS , the COpyright Protection System.

      I have found existing tools to convert LaTeX into HTML a little
      frustrating so I wrote my own simple tool which relies mostly on a LaTeX
